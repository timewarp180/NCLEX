the quiz summary is missing score, percentage and time taken, or if you like you can add up another content in there. all of the questionnaire type should be applicable to the quiz summary, also if i include the scenario-dropdown type questionnaire, the quiz summary doesnt show anything, typically the quiz summary is so buggy, can you fix it or revamp it to be working after answering to all the questionnaire type, (scenario-dropdown, fill-blank, medication-matching , priority, select-all, multiple-choice)
